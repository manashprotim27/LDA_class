GT   I decided to buy myself a gift   a more exotic car   Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche           model years   I narrowed it down to those two   I liked the simplicity and handling  and snob appeal  too  of driving a Porsche   The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance   almost a personal luxury car   It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the      I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the      but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way   I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car     If you buy the Supra  your rate classification will be the same as the Celica  the     Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars   with a slight increase because the car will be   years newer   Our lower risk division will continue to handle your account     If you buy the Porsche      we ll have to change you to the standard  higher  rate company and your rate will double   And if you go with a      it s another story again   we ll cover the rest of this year  but cancel you after that      But the Supra is much faster than the      and the     is actually faster than the  standard        That doens t make sense      That s what the book says   We don t insure Corvettes  either   For some reason  the underwriters consider Supras   and their drivers   as very traditional and conservative     I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons   The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested  but a tough high pressure guy in the back room   At equal monthly payments  it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche  plus its higher insurance   I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft                                            Everyone s entitled to MY opinion                   _    _     _   _          goldberg oasys dt navy mil

counters        CASSINI   Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe  Cassini is a joint     NASA ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe  Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV Centaur in October of           After gravity assists of Venus  Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory  the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of       Upon     arrival  the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn  Near the end of this initial orbit  the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan  The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about   hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface  After the completion of the Probe mission  the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years  Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about    flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus  Dione and Enceladus  The objectives of the     mission are threefold  conduct detailed studies of Saturn s atmosphere      rings and magnetosphere  conduct close up studies of Saturn s     satellites  and characterize Titan s atmosphere and surface       One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere  These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface  The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface  Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere       The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini              the     first director of the Paris Observatory  who discovered several of     Saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings  The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens              who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturn s rings   \\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission  VVEJGA Trajectory

else they could to  ease Russian occupation  The atrocities committed by the Armenian   volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the   Russian commanders themselves were

exterminated by the Armenians    Why     Who gives a thunder about your pseudo scholar jokes  I am arguing about    the Armenian Nazi colaboration during World War II  Any comment    It could be  perhaps  your head wasn t screwed on just right  In        while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration  camps  the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian  battalion to fight alongside the Nazis  In       this battalion had  grown into eight battalions of        strong under the command of the former guerilla leader Dro  the butcher   who was the former dictator of the short lived Armenian Dictatorship             and the architect of the  cold blooded genocide of     million Turks and Kurds between            An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party  leaders in Berlin  which was recognized by the Nazis  Encouraged by  this  the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed  and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the  members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler s policy of  extermination of the Jews   This Armenian Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an  encore  performance staged by the Armenians during WWI  when they back stabbed and exterminated     million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army   Furthermore  as McCarthy put it  the Armenian dictatorship was granted a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros Armistice with the Allies  October            The Allies had decided to create a Greater Armenia  including the old Russian province of Yerevan and adjoining areas  as well as most parts of Anatolia claimed by the Armenian fanatics  Only the area called Cilicia  around the Ottoman province of Adana  was to be excluded  as it had already been claimed by the French  The Allies quickly set about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks  who could be expected to oppose their plans    On April          the British Army occupied Kars  gave civilian and military power over to the Armenians  then withdrew  The British planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship  even  though the Russian pre war census had shown Kars Province to be over     Muslim  The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed  but the  British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains  The fate of the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier in Eastern Anatolia  Murder  pillage  genocide and the destruction of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded by remaining units of the Ottoman Army  The British had left  the scene to the Armenian genocide squads  Therefore  few  Europeans were present to observe the genocide  One British soldier  Colonel Rawlinson  who was assigned to supervise the disarmament of Otoman soldiers  saw what was occurring    Rawlinson wired to his superiors     in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in  independent command of the Moslim population  as  their troops   being without discipline and not being under effective control   atrocities were constantly being committed      Come again      These European Dashnags  with headquarters in Berlin  appealed to     Why     No

our country which are alike in the  calamities and destruction which they suffered  have been destroyed   as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of  these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the   destruction suffered during the two year Russian occupation    All barracks buildings of Erzincan  the cavalry barracks in Erzurum   the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those  burnt  In short  both cities are burnt  destroyed and trees cut down    As to the people of these cities    All people old enough to use weapons rounded up  taken to the Sarikamis  direction for road building and were slaughtered  The remaining people   were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the   withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown   into wells  burnt in houses  mutilated by bayonets  their abdomens  ripped open in slaughterhouses  their lungs and livers torn out  girls  and women hung up by their hair  after all kinds of devilish acts   The few people who were able to survive these cruelties  worse than  those of the  Spanish Inquisition   are in poverty more dead than alive   horrified  some driven insane  about      in Erzincan and        in  Erzurum  The people are hungry and in poverty  for whatever they had  has been taken away from them  their lands left uncultivated    The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in  stores left over from the Russians  The villages round Erzincan and   Erzurum are in the worst condition  Some villages on the road  have   been leveled to the ground  leaving no stone  the people completely  massacred    Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that  history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions        a long list      a long list    And still anxiously awaiting     Serdar Argic',\n",

              " '    Watch out   Often when some scumbag steals the cover  that means    that they were or are looking to steal the bike   In my case  I    had a faded cover stolen off a bmw R   RS that was stashed in an    apartment carport and not visible from the street   They evidently    decided the beemer wasn t worth stealing  but did try the next night to    steal a Honda Hurricane     parked in the next apartment building     A neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops    I know this is just setting myself up  but this is actually one of the things that is really good about BMW bikes   From all accounts I ve heard practically no one steals BMWs  Probably it is similar for Moto Guzzis and other relative  exotics  since there isn t a large demand for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down  It seems that the most stolen bikes are Harleys and    cc Jap sport bikes   ',\n",

dates and other information      periodically there  The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE FAQ manifest  The portion of his manifest formerly     included in this FAQ

Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci space news     frequently        WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF       The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks      kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov        The  Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual   ASC G C        \\t During the vertical rise phase  the launch pad attitude is \\tcommanded until an I loaded V rel  sufficient to assure launch tower \\tclearance is achieved  Then  the tilt maneuver  roll program  \\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a \\tnegative q alpha  which in turn alleviates structural loading  Other \\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain  decreased abort \\tmaneuver complexity  improved S band look angles  and crew view of \\tthe horizon  The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining \\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff  MECO  target \\tin second stage        This really is a good answer  but it s couched in NASA jargon  I ll try     to interpret         \\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling         \\tThen  we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack \\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere  the \\t relative wind   and the chord of the wings  the imaginary line \\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge  is a slightly \\tnegative angle   a negative q alpha   \\tThis causes a little bit of \\t downward  force  toward the belly of the Orbiter  or the  Z \\tdirection  and this force  alleviates structural loading   \\tWe have to be careful about those wings    they re about the \\tmost  delicate  part of the vehicle         \\tThe new attitude  after the roll  also allows us to carry more \\tmass to orbit  or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass  or \\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be \\tthe case if we didn t roll   performance gain           \\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated \\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort \\tmaneuvers  the Return To Launch Site   decreased abort maneuver \\tcomplexity           \\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio \\tantennae to have a good line of sight signal with the S band radio \\tantennae on the Orbiter   improved S band look angles           \\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon  which is a \\thelpful  but not mandatory  part of piloting any flying machine         \\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is \\tmore nearly parallel with the ground  and the nose to the east \\t usually    This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity \\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit   Remember  \\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction  \\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its \\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit       This all begs the question   Why isn t the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with   Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude    The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days   The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches    one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust  one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust    You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch   The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage  and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam   Watch for the difference between the  top       Orbiter side  and the  bottom   External Tank side  of the stack   The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn V s    A side note  the     Saturn V s also had a roll program   Don t ask me why    I m a Shuttle     guy        I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics \\tHe added that the  roll     maneuver  is really a maneuver in all three axes  roll  pitch and yaw      The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated   The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack  q alpha  within a tight tolerance   The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination   The total     maneuver is really expressed as a  quaternion   a grad level math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element     array        HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL  NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is

              " 'Hello src readers   Again the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox Churches believe in Monophysitism pops up again  We had a discussion about it a while ago     Then OFM comments     With my appreciation to the moderator  I believe that further elaboration is needed  This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt Net Newsletter    Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople  as opposed to the western empire of Rome   the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology   They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith  St  Cyril  Pope of Alexandria  was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year     A D  It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings  This leading role  however  did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs   It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church  The response of St  Dioscorus  the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled  to this interference was clear   You have nothing to do with the Church    These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in      when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches  who believed  in monophysitism  This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature  the divine  not two natures  the human as well as the divine   The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon   In  that Council  monophysitism meant believing in one  nature   Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity   and He   is perfect in  His humanity   but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called  the nature of the incarnate word   which was reiterated by St  Cyril of Alexandria   Copts  thus  believe in two natures  human  and    divine   that are   united in   one  without mingling  without confusion  and without alteration   from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy    These  two  natures  did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye   also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy    The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the  th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon   Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly  but  they wanted to exile the  Church    to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian  independent Pope  Despite  all of this   the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith    Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced  or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn t  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite  the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile  semantic  differences between all  Christian  Churches    This is   aptly  expressed by the  current     th successor  of  St  Mark  Pope Shenouda III    To the  Coptic Church  faith is more  important  than  anything  and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us    Throughout this  century   the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement  The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches  It has remained a member of that  council  since      A D    The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches   AACC   and the  Middle East Council of  Churches  MECC    The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic  Greek Orthodox  Presbyterian  and Evangelical Churches          As a final note  the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology  in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned  So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism   Peace   Nabil                                                                                        Nabil Ayoub                        ____    __       ____                Engine

is confused   I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite   As Andrew Byler correctly stated it  the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties   The point I was making  which Nabil explains in some detail  is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren t   Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups  the Alexandrians and Antiochenes   It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps  while ruling out the extremes   I agree that there were extremes that were heretical   However in the course of the complex politics of the time  it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy  but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented   And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine   There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps   This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians   There are also a remaining Nestorians   Like some of the current so called monophysites  there is reason to believe that the current so called Nestorians are not heretical either   They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment  but claim they did not adopt his heresies  and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition ',\n",

              " 'Michael Bushnell writes    Which is exactly what I pointed out    Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed  the      Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque   Apparently that has changed    The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque  the Nicene   Constantinopolitan did not  \\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed  it wasn t there to begin with   but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed  which did have it from the beginning  \\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity  the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son  and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son   In fact  some  such as Tertullian  used both formulations  see below   \\t Following  therefore  the form of these examples  I profess that I do call God and His Word    the Father and and His Son    two   For the root and the stem are two things  but conjoined  the fountain and the river are two kinds  but indivisible  the sun and the ray are two forms  but coherent ones   Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds  but it is not on that account separated from it   Where there is second  however  there are two  and where ther is third  there are three   The Spirit  then  is third from God and the Son  just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem  and third from the fountain is the stream from the river  and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray   \\t Tertullian  Against Praxeas        about     AD   and  \\t I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son  \\t Tertullian  Against Praxeas        about     AD   And as St  Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part    Question     Articles   and    there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation  and in fact  the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St  Augustine  among others taught  that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son  but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way   \\t For whatever the Son has  He has from the Father  certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him     For the Father alone is not from another  for which reason He alone is called unbegotten  not  indeed  in the Scriptures  but in the practice of theologians  and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great   The Son  however  is born of the Father  and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father  and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time  the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son   He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if  which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind  they had both begotten Him   The Spirit was not begotten by each  however  but proceeds from each and both   \\t St  Augustine of Hippo  The Trinity                  to     AD   So  in a sense  all of the formulations are correct  to the West at least   because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son  but in proceeding from the Son  the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father  so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son  but as all that the Son has is from the Father  the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father  without any mention of the Son being necessary  \\tIn any case  I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St  Leo I  St  Fulgence of Ruspe  St  Cyril of Alexandria  Pope St  Damsus I  St  Augustine of Hippo  St  Epiphanius of Salamis  St  Ambrose of Milan  St  Hilary of Poitiers  Tertullian  and others among the Fathers  who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position  which I enunciated above  \\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden  I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone  to produce  write  or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea    That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople  which is commonly called the Nicene Creed   Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed  which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea  but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious  who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church  which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son   Thus  the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this  and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son  which Nestorius denied  they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed  for they themselves approved of previous additions to it   And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical  it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain  because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others   And that the filioque was not disputed  I provide more quotes below   \\t Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God  and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son  it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence  in it in essence and proceeding from it   \\t St  Cyril of Alexandria  The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity  Thesis              AD   \\t The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only  or of the Son only  but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son   For it is written   If anyone loves the world  the Spirit of the Father is not in him   and again it is written   If anyone  however  does not have the Spirit of Christ  he is none of His    When the Father and the Son are named in this way  the Holy Spirit is understood  of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel  that the Holy Spirit  proceeds from the Father   and that  He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you    \\t Pope St  Damasus I  The Decree of Damasus         AD   \\t The only begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father  but is called Holy Spirit  and is not foreign to the Father   For the Only begotten Himself calls Him   the Spirit of the Father   and says of Him the  He proceeds from the Father   and  will receive of mine   so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son  but is of their same substance  of the same Godhead  He is Spirit divine      of God  and He is God   For he is Spirit of God  Spirit of the Father  and Spirit of the Son  not by some kind of synthesis  like soul and body in us  but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son  a third by appelation     \\t The Father always existed and the Son always existed  and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son  and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created   \\t St  Epiphanius of Salamis  which is on Cyprus   The Man Well Anchored    and         AD   \\t Concerning the Holy Spirit  I ought not to remain silent  nor yet is it necessary to speak   Still  on account of those who do not know Him  it is not possible for me to be silent   However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged  who is from the Father and the Son  His Sources   \\t St  Hilary of Poitiers  The Trintiy             to     AD   \\tThus  as I have pointed out before  Gaul  Spain  Italy  Africa  Egypt  Palastine  and the lands of the Greeks  all of Christnedom at that time  all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque   I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers  besides St  John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque  to support their views   It is not enough to bring up the  proceeds from the Father  line of the Creed or the Gospel of John  for that says what we believe also   But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son  only that He does proceed from the Father ',\n",

argument on Usenet  the general quality of argument found is poor   This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic  in the hope of improving the general level of debate   Logic is the science of reasoning  proof  thinking  or inference  Concise OED    Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not  valid or invalid    Of course  one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly  nevertheless  a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument   Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable   The matter is very much open for debate   This document merely explains how to use logic  given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job   Propositions  or statements  are the building blocks of a logical argument  A proposition is a statement which is either true or false  for example   It is raining  or  Today is Tuesday    Propositions may be either asserted  said to be true  or denied  said to be false    Note that this is a technical meaning of  deny   not the everyday meaning   The proposition is the meaning of the statement  not the particular arrangement of words used to express it   So  God exists  and  There exists a God  both express the same proposition   An argument is  to quote the Monty Python sketch   a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition    An argument consists of three stages   First of all  the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated   These are called the premises of the argument   They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions    Premises  or assertions  are often indicated by phrases such as  because    since    obviously  and so on    The phrase  obviously  is often viewed with suspicion  as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises   If something doesn t seem obvious to you  don t be afraid to question it   You can always say  Oh  yes  you re right  it is obvious  when you ve heard the explanation    Next  the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference   In inference  one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted   There are various forms of valid inference   The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference   Inference is often denoted by phrases such as  implies that  or  therefore    Finally  we arrive at the conclusion of the argument    the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference   Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as  therefore    it follows that    we conclude  and so on   The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference   For example   Every event has a cause  premise  The universe has a beginning  premise  All beginnings involve an event  premise  This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event  inference  Therefore the universe has a cause  inference and conclusion   Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument   A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument  the terms do not make sense in isolation   Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above  for example  the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated  afterwards in support of the conclusion   This is perfectly valid  if  sometimes a little confusing   Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions   Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument   Some statements look like arguments  but are not   For example    If the Bible is accurate  Jesus must either have been insane  an evil liar   or the Son of God    This is not an argument  it is a conditional statement   It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its  conclusion    It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws  but we ll come to those later    Another example    God created you  therefore do your duty to God    The phrase  do your duty to God  is not a proposition  since it is neither true nor false   Therefore it is not a conclusion  and the sentence is not an argument   Finally  causality is important   Consider a statement of the form  A because B    If we re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence  the statement is an argument   If we re trying to establish the truth of B  then it is not an argument  it is an explanation   For example    There must be something wrong with the engine of my car  because it will not  start      This is an argument    My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine       This is an explanation   There are two traditional types of argument  deductive and inductive   A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions    that is  an argument where if the premises are true  the conclusion must also be true   A deductive argument is either valid or invalid   A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true  then the conclusion is true   An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion   Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid  however  we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments  and about how probable their premises are   There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive   However  we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments  as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing   It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds   This is because of the slightly  counter intuitive nature of implication  which we must now consider more carefully   Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions   However  an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions   For example      All insects have wings  premise     Woodlice are insects  premise     Therefore woodlice have wings  conclusion   Here  the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false   If the argument s premises were true  however  the conclusion would be true   The argument is thus entirely valid   More subtly  we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises  as in      All fish live in the sea  premise     Dolphins are fish  premise     Therefore dolphins live in the sea  conclusion   However  the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises   We can therefore draw up a  truth table  for implication   The symbol      denotes implication   A  is the premise   B  the conclusion    T  and  F  represent true and false respectively   Premise Conclusion Inference    A        B        A  B                                 F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference    F        T         T      valid  the conclusion can be true or false      T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion                              false  the inference must be invalid      T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid                               the conclusion must be true   A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true   A sound  argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion   Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments   To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy   It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument   These pitfalls are known as fallacies   In everyday English the term  fallacy  is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs   This is fair enough  but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument  especially if the argument appears valid or convincing   So for the purposes of this discussion  we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct  but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely   By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them   The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive   ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM  APPEAL TO FORCE   The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion   It is often used by politicians  and can be summarized as  might makes right    The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer   For example       Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible   All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell    ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally  argument directed at the man    The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when  instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion  the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion   This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it   For example   Atheism is an evil philosophy   It is practised by Communists and murderers    Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by  showing  for example  that he is a known perjurer   This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness  and not argumentum ad hominem  however  it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false   To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam  see elsewhere in this list    The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances   For example   It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food   How can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes    This is an abusive charge of inconsistency  used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument   This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion   For  example    Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing   You re white    This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem  when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests  is also known as  poisoning the well    ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means  argument from ignorance    This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false   Or  equivalently  when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true    Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true  a basic scientific principle    Examples   Of course the Bible is true   Nobody can prove otherwise     Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist   Nobody has shown any proof that they are real    Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law  where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty   Also  in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred  the absence of such evidence can  validly be used to infer that the event did not occur   For example    A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth   The earth does not have a tenth as much water  even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles   Therefore no such flood occurred    In science  we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred   We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred  however   ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity  also known as Special Pleading   The fallacy is  committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a  conclusion accepted   For example    I did not murder my mother and father with an axe   Please don t find me guilty  I m suffering enough through being an orphan    ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery  or Appealing to the People   To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people   This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language   For example    Pornography must be banned   It is violence against women     The Bible must be true   Millions of people know that it is   Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools    ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum   It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition  the more likely it is that that proposition is correct   ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion   For example    Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God    This line of argument is not always completely bogus  for example  reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject   For example  we can distinguish quite clearly between    Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation  and  John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent  computer   Hawking is a physicist  and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed   Searle is a linguist  so it is questionable  whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence   THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose  accidental  circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable   It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific   For example    Christians generally dislike atheists   You are a Christian  so you must dislike atheists    This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules   CONVERSE ACCIDENT   HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident   It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases   For example   Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian   Therefore all Christians are insincere    SWEEPING GENERALIZATION   DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable   A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization   NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA   POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies   The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause   For  example    I took an aspirin and prayed to God  and my headache disappeared   So God cured me of the headache    The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event   For  example    The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism   Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons    CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc   It asserts that because two events occur together  they must be causally related  and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s  of the events   PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached   CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach   Often  the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument   For example    Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office   Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job   Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret  and will be open to blackmail   Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office    Note that the argument is entirely circular  the premise is the same as the  conclusion   An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services  official ban on homosexual employees   Another example is the classic    We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so   And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God    COMPLEX QUESTION   FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition   One example is the classic loaded  question    Have you stopped beating your wife    The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked   This trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination  when they ask questions like    Where did you hide the money you stole    Similarly  politicians often ask loaded questions such as    How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue   or  Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization    IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument  supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion   For example  a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true   If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people  no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true   Sadly  such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light   EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument   For example    What could be more affordable than free software   But to make sure that it remains free  that users can do what they like with it  we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable    AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing   ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning   In this case  the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized   For example  consider    We should not speak ILL of our friends  and  We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS   FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole   For example    The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components  and is therefore very  lightweight    The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items   For example    A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus   Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses    FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition   Like its opposite  it exists in two varieties   The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts   For example    You are studying at a rich college   Therefore you must be rich    The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item   For example    Ants can destroy a tree   Therefore this ant can destroy a tree    THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur  so will other harmful events   There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event   For example   If we legalize marijuana  then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare   Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana     A IS BASED ON B  FALLACIES    IS A TYPE OF  FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar   Examples   Isn t history based upon faith   If so  then isn t the Bible also a form of history     Islam is based on faith  Christianity is based on faith  so isn t Islam a form of Christianity     Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry  dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry  so aren t dogs a form of cat    AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form  A implies B  B is true  therefore A is true    To understand why it is a fallacy  examine the truth table for implication given earlier   DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form  A implies B  A is false  therefore B is false    Again  the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy   Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa  the latter has the form  A implies B  A is false  therefore B is false   where A does NOT in fact imply B at all   Here  the problem is not that the implication is invalid  rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B   CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form  If A then B  therefore if B then A    ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old  or because  that s the way it s always been    ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam  it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else   ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness  that those with more money are more likely to be right   ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier   This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam   ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard   An  argumentum ad nauseum  is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something   BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the  black and white  fallacy  bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives  where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist   PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM   MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question   NON SEQUITUR  A non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it   RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed  so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made  towards a different conclusion   REIFICATION   HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing   SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition   Shifting the burden of proof  a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium  is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made   The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise   STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily  then to knock down that misrepresented position  then to conclude that the original position has been demolished   It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made   THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over   The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two  different situations  in an argument about a general rule  constitutes a  claim that those situations are analogous to each other   This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about  anti cryptography legislation    I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it     Such a position is odious  it implies that you would not have supported  Martin Luther King     Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the  struggle for Black liberation   How dare you    TU QUOQUE  This is the famous  you too  fallacy   It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it   For instance    You re just being randomly abusive    So   You ve been abusive too  ',\n",

              " '  Dr  Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally  be believed  I have been observing that  Poly  has been practicing  Goebels  rule quite loyally   Poly s audience is mostly made of Greeks  who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news  However  in today s  informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves  For  instance  those who lived in      will remember the TV news they  watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can  read the American newspapers of July and August      to find out what  really happened    There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital  The Greek Girls  Lycee  Alumni Association  the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society   the Greek Medical Foundation  the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation   the Yovakimion Greek Girls  Lycee Foundation  and the Fener Greek  Men s Lycee Foundation     As for Greece  the longstanding use of the adjective  Turkish   in titles and on signboards is prohibited  The Greek courts  have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers  Association   the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti  Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks in Western Thrace  Such community associations had been  active until       But they were first told to remove the word  Turkish  on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down  This is also the  final verdict  November          of the Greek High Court   In the city of Komotini  a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish parentage  was sentenced recently to    months of imprisonment with no right to appeal  just for saying outloud that he was of Turkish descent  This duly elected ethnic Turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three  years  Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than  a vehicle  used by the Greek governments  to cover up their inferiority  complex they display  vis a vis  the people of Turkiye    The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term  Turks    which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference  to  Muslims   The fact that the Greek governments also mention the  existence of a few thousand non Turkish Muslims does not change the  essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger  Turkish minority  The  Pomaks  are also a Muslim people  whom all the  three nations  Bulgarians  Turks  and Greeks  consider as part of  themselves  Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized  according to the agreements  Poor  Poly    It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece  and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world  The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish minority  They pursue the same denial in connection with  the Macedonians of Greece  Talk about oppression  In addition  in      the  democratic  Greek Parliament passed Law No        virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts  They have ceased to be self supporting religious and cultural entities  Talk about fascism  The Greek  governments are attempting to appoint the muftus  irrespective of the will of the Turkish minority  as state official  Although the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in Greece  the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders  Talk about democracy   The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic  convention in Komotini  Such destruction  which reflects an  attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a  violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the  so called   Greek Constitution  which is supposed to guarantee the protection  of historical monuments    The government of Greece  on the other hand  is building new  churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward  Hellenizing the region   And you pondered  Sidiropoulos  the president of the Macedonian Human  Rights Committee  became the latest victim of a tactic long used by  the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation  of the Macedonian minority  A forestry official by occupation   Sidiropoulos has been sent to  internal exile  on the island of  Kefalonia  hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina   His employer  the Florina City Council  asked him to depart in     hours  The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his  involvement in Copenhagen  He returned to Florina by his own choice  and remains without a job    Helsinki Watch  a well known Human Rights group  had been investigating  the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece  In August       their  findings were published in a report titled     Destroying Ethnic Identity  Turks of Greece    The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the  Turkish minority by the Greek authorities  It says for instance   the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in  Komotini  Such destruction  which reflects an attitude against  the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage  is a violation of the  Lausanne Convention    The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik were attacked  and tombstones were broken  The cemetery in Karotas was razed by bulldozers   Shall I go on  Why not  The people of Turkiye are not going  to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government  The  discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not  stop at the Greek frontier  In several following articles  I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians   It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration  has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made  plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it  has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on  conventional arms reductions in Europe  Meanwhile  Greek  and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned  to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the  transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern  Cyprus  a process that will conflict with the spirit of  the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe   An acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will  But we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings  The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were  dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there   Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana   Now wait  there is more      Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna  May to July        Inedited   Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers   Published by   The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne  Lausanne    Imprimerie Petter  Giesser   Held  Caroline               pages               The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus    and the    Turkish travellers  men and women who were in it ordered    to descend  And there in the open street  under the eyes of their    husbands  fathers and brothers  the women without distinction of age    were violated  and then all the travellers were massacred  Amongst    the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi  a native of Tripoli  and a    captain whose name is not known  and to whom the Hellenic authorities    had given safe conduct  were killed with specially atrocious tortures         Before the battle  the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from    her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers  she was even stript    of her garments and her servant Assie was violated         The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the    following manner  Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire    and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt    end of a gun         During the firing of the town  eleven children  six little girls    and five boys  fleeing from the flames  were stopped by Greek soldiers    in the Ramazan Pacha quarter  and thrown into a burning Jewish house    near bridge  where they were burnt alive  This fact is confirmed on oath    by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it         The clock maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and    dragged out of their shop  The son had his eyes put out and was then    killed in the court of the Greek Church  but Ahmed Effendi has been    no more heard of         At the market  during the fire  two unknown people were wounded    by bayonets  then bound together  thrown into the fire and burnt alive      The Greeks killed also many Jews  These are the names of some     Moussa Malki  shoemaker          killed   Bohor Levy  tailor

              " ' This is a co authored report from two of us who were there    Gun Owners Action League  our state rifle association  started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at       It was looking sparse  about    people  until the speaker began  whereupon about     more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost  and filled out the area something proud   Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke   One of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state  while the people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of  election fraud  to hold their jobs   Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings  and telling people where to find their own representatives  and in too many cases  who they were    Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn t made it onto the official list   It seems a delegation of students from Simon s Rock of Bard College  alma mater of Wayne Lo  who shot up the place with an SKS late last year  was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident   The hearings were originally scheduled in the  large  Gardner Auditorium at        but that had been pre empted by the Governor s hearings on the Framingham Eight  women in prison for killing abusive husbands  and seeking release    So we had until      to buttonhole our representatives  after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room   One of my representatives  staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy  He said   Oh  it must be gun hearings day again   The gun lobby is always so organized every year    I got a little pissed  and replied   I m not from the gun lobby    I m from your district    At        your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse  where the pro gunners weren t    Randy Price from the TV News was there  in his mirror reflective shades  talking to one of the anti gun types  and several Simon s Rock anti gun  close the loophole  protestors   Earlier  Randy had covered the GOAL rally    The room we had been assigned seated about      Remember  there were about     gun owners there  plus another       students and teachers from Bard   One of us had already reserved a seat  the other never got closer than the atrium outside    and there was a crowd behind HIM   A cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in   Soon after the debate started  a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else   Everyone who was there  inside and outside  got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills   Most of us signed up to  support GOAL s position  on  all bills    First  because of their time constraints  public officials got to testify   And first up was the bill that nobody had seen  the students had some curfew  I guess      Currently  Massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state   Previously  the law was similar  but applied only to non residents from states adjoining Massachusetts   The Simon s Rock folks called the current law a  loophole  and wanted it closed   Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his  SKS assault rifle   The second one  Hodgekiss  a co sponsor  had done his homework so well that he kept confusing Montana  Wayne Lo s home state  with Missouri  and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff   Carr  from Gloucester  claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was  but he was lying  the new bill allows purchases by non residents of adjoining states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state  as strong as  that in Massachusetts   Since none of them do  that s that   Some of the things these two said were really offensive    In some of these other states  anyone can buy a gun as long as he s breathing    Oooooo     We have some very  very good gun laws in Massachusetts  if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws  we wouldn t be having this situation    but they won t     Naughty  naughty    Next up was Boston city councilman Albert  Dapper  O Neill   He was there to testify pro gun  but in some ways he was a liability   He s reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself  plus he s almost a caricature of a law n order politician   He badmouthed the ACLU  said violent criminals should be executed  and that if he were judge  he d give arrestees their  last rights   pun intended  on the spot  at which many of the gun owners applauded  which bothered me   He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction    for the criminals   He said this FOUR times      Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a CCW or FID  and confiscate all your guns  if someone had filed a restraining order against you    Note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant  no hearing  no evidence  and no conviction    just an accusation    Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor of it  and patronized the pro gunners there several times by saying   I m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted    I haven t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since Nixon whined that he wasn t a crook   Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable every five years  instead of permanent as it is now   The stated purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible   Revenue has nothing to do with it     Yeah  right    Apparently  some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s preferable to process     million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time   As usual  hassle the law abiding instead of the crook   The two co chairs of the committee were Rep  Caron and Sen  Jujuga  Jujuga didn t say much  he was a co sponsor of both  restraining order  bills  but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged    He  was a co sponsor of one of the  restraining order  bills as well    One of the younger reps on the committee  forgot his name  was vociferously pro gun  somewhat embarrassingly so   His heart was in the right place  but his arguments seemed to be confined to   every year it s the same damn thing  you come in here with this crap     It s nice to have a friend on the committee  but he could have been more effective   At about       it was clear that the hall jam couldn t continue  Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting  so the loudspeaker was disconnected   So they found a bigger hall upstairs   One of us had to leave to catch his charter bus  and so missed the  public  testimony  the other got a seat this time   Caron began by talking about how he got his FID    years ago  left the state  and then returned without notifying them of his address change  He complained that the state record system was not up to date and that his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there   Great quote   If you purchase a gun today  it will not get into the state computer system until          This was also an argument he used against the renewable FID card    Testimony was heard from several  battered women   one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his    s who had an FID card because he got it when he was    or thereabouts   They used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men   A staffer of Attorney General Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti gun bill  saying how        restraining orders were granted last year  and how these women needed to be protected   Caron noted that a restraining order was granted for    days  and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year   He asked whether she would be satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the FID   She gave some long rambling circumlocution in response   Then testimony against the bill was heard   Mike Yacino  who looks something like Einstein  got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence  that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right  man or woman   and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts  Atty  Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony   Other pro gunners got up to testify   One said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out  and that she countered by filing one against him   He noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law  One of the junior reps noted that  this is America  and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected   Senator Jujuga reiterated this  saying that  people who abuse smaller people can go to Hell as far as I care  but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order     Point and match  Senator    Another pro gunner got up and testified that he didn t know his citizenship  expired every   years   and that a driver s license was a privilege  not a right like the right to keep and bear arms   A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system  and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings   Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed  and joking responded that he  too  favored public hangings   The speaker then responded   I ll make you a deal   You get me the rope  and I ll tie the noose    Next came public testimony on the Simon s Rock bill   A teacher testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo  and that  he wouldn t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside  without his evil gun   She said that the  loophole  should be closed to prevent something like this from  ever happening again    Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill  one of spilling tears for the good legislators   One of the students actually shot by Wayne Lo was also there   Many of them had T shirts on  saying   As long as one person can buy a gun in anger  none of us are safe    support gun control    The committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids  except for Caron  who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an FID    Only residents can get FID s   he said    How much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out of staters completely off    Yacino and McNutt spoke again  this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by out of staters   Karen also noted that hunters in CT  NH  and VT could be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens   Yacino underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident student    and  hell  even an CCW  as he had NO criminal or mental record   One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy a gun than out of staters  and thought it was  elitist    Another  Caron   said that we need the protection of preventing non residents from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union had  FID type  cards  so complying with all the laws of one s home state was  not enough    One pro gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming   Everyone s out of step but Johnny    All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro gun testimony for this bill was made  and thus only pro gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration   The main bills remaining  and GOAL s position  were   o  H      and four others  Notify police chiefs so they can pull     licenses when a holder is convicted  strongly supported   o  H       Require trigger locks on all handguns sold  opposed   o  H      Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms  strongly    opposed   o  H       Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws      opposed   o  H       Fund bullet proof vests for municipal police  supported   o  S       State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA  supported   o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards  opposed   o  Several altering non resident license conditions  supported   o  H       Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state  guess    Some of these took only    seconds to consider  as the remaining pro gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them   Mike Yacino noted that  besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun  that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked   Caron blew right through H      when he saw that we opposed it  Again  he brought up the state s archaic records capability and said   This would create hundreds of different licensing systems    The session ran late    since it was the last scheduled hearing  it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified   It ended at about          ',\n",

announcement       Q  How do I become an astronaut       A  We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut  since it s probably     impossible for a non Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps  paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts   and the other nations have     so few astronauts  and fly even fewer  that you re better off hoping to     win a lottery  Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet     experience  which means a military flying career  forget that unless you     want to do it anyway  So you want to become a shuttle  mission     specialist        If you aren t a US citizen  become one  that is a must   After that      the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply   NASA s problem is not finding qualified people      but thinning the lineup down to manageable length \\tIt is not enough     to be qualified  you must avoid being  dis qualified for any reason      many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job       Get a Ph D   Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment  not just paper and pencil   Forget computer     programming entirely  it will be done from the ground for the fore      seeable future   Degree s  in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner       Be in good physical condition  with good eyesight \\t DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision  nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes  and long term     effects are poorly understood   For that matter  avoid any other     significant medical unknowns    If you can pass a jet pilot physical      you should be okay  if you can t  your chances are poor       Practise public speaking  and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions  you ve got a tough selling job ahead  trying     to convince a cautious  conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants    And  also  that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are hired   public relations is     a significant part of the job  and NASA s image is very prim and     proper    The image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie      Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point      and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent      Keep your nose clean       Get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby      experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs       Work for NASA  of

that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine  The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into  and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to    days  It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew       The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites  service of existing satellites  operation     of specialized laboratories  astronomy  earth sciences  materials     processing  manufacturing   and other operations  These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station  The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself  Users of the Space     Shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries       The crew normally consists of five people   the commander  the pilot      and three mission specialists  On occasion additional crew members are     assigned  The commander  pilot  and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts       Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots      During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle      crew  mission success and safety in flight  The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle  In addition  the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system  in extra vehicular activities  and other     payload operations       Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts  working with the commander and pilot      have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning  consumables usage  and     experiment and payload operations  Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems  as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics  mission requirements and     objectives  and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions  Mission     specialists will perform extra vehicular activities  payload handling     using the remote manipulator

    their establishment       General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center  Houston      Texas  The astronaut candidates will undergo a   year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs  They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight  Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period       Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut  Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the   year training and     evaluation period  Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years  Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time  Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty       NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates      Therefore  qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply       Pay and Benefits                           Civilians

events  the   th and the   th  of February   I was away on a business trip  On the   th I had got my crew  done the paper  work  and left for the Zhdanov District  That s in Azerbaijan  near the Nagorno Karabagh region   After the   th  rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh  specifically in Stepanakert  an uprising had taken place  They said  uprising  in Azerbaijani  but I don t think it was really an uprising  just a  demonstration  After that the unrest started  Several Armenians living in the  Zhdanov District were injured  How were they injured  They were beaten  even  women  it was said that they were at the demonstrations  but they live here   and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate  After that I felt uneasy  There were some conversations about Armenians among the local population  the Armenians had done this  the Armenians had done that  Right there at the site  I was attacked a couple of times by kids  Well true  the guys from my crew  wouldn t let them come at me with cables and knives  After that I felt really  bad  I didn t know where to go  I up and called home  And my children tell me   There s unrest everywhere  be careful   Well I had a project going on  I told the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on  and said I wanted to take my crew off the site  They wouldn t allow it  they  said   Nothing s going to happen to you  we ve entrusted the matter to the  police  we ve warned everyone in the district  nothing will happen to you    Well  in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me  he  knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened  This man didn t leave me alone for five minutes  he was at work the whole time and  afterward he spent the night with us  too   I sense some disquiet and call home  my wife also tells me   The situation is very tense  be careful    We finished the job at the site  and I left for Sumgait first thing on the morning of the   th  When we left the guys warned me  they told me that I shouldn t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian  I took someone else s business travel documents  in the name of Zardali  and hid my own  I hid it  and my passport in my socks  We set out for Baku  Our guys were on the bus   they sat behind  and I sat up front  In Baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case  As it turns out  they knew what was happening in Sumgait   I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is closed  there is no way to get there  That the city is closed off and the  buses aren t running  Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two minutes  And suddenly  no buses  Well  we tried to get there via private drivers  One man  an Azerbaijani  said   Let s go find some other way to get there   They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to Sumgait   He took us there  But the others had said   I wouldn t go if you gave me a thousand rubles    Why    Because they re burning the city and killing the Armenians  There isn t an Armenian left   Well I got hold of myself so I could still stand up  So we squared it away  the four of us got in the car  and we  set off for Sumgait  On the way the driver says   In fact there aren t any Armenians left   They burned them all  beat them all  and stabbed them   Well  I was silent  The whole way     odd miles  I was silent  The driver asks me    How old are you  old man   He wants to know  if I m being that quiet  not  saying anything  maybe it means I m an Armenian   How old are you   he asks  me  I say   I m       I m    too  but I call you  old man    I say   It  depends on God  each person s life in this world is different   I look much older than my years  that s why he called me old man  Well after that he was silent  too   We re approaching the city  I look and see tanks all around  and a cordon  Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand  Well  he was waving his hand  we all start waving our hands  I m sitting there with them  I start waving my hand  too  I realized that this was a sign that meant there were no Armenians with us   I look at the city  there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the  street  you know  and there s no traffic  Well probably I was scared  They stopped our car  People were standing on the sidewalks  They have armature  shafts  and stones       And they stopped us        Along the way the driver tells us how they know who s an Armenian and who s  not  The Armenians usually       For example  I m an Armenian  but I speak  their language very well  Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for   nut   or  little nut   as  pundukh   but  fundukh  is actually correct  The  pronunciations are different  Anyone who says  pundukh   even if they re not  Armenian  they immediately take out and start to slash  Another one says    There was a car there  with five people inside it   he says   They started  hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire  And they didn t let the people out   he says   they wouldn t let them get out of the car   I only saw  the car  but the driver says that he saw everything  Well he often drives from Baku to Sumgait and back        When they stop us we all get out of the car  I look and there s a short guy  his eyes are gleaming  he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one   We re Azerbaijani   they tell him   no Armenians here   He did come up to me when  we were pulling our things out and says   Maybe you re an Armenian  old man    But in Azerbaijani I say   You should be ashamed of yourself   And       he  left  Turned and left  That was all that happened  What was I to do  I had  to       the city was on fire  but I had to steal my children out of my own  home   They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street  that s where the Kavkaz store  and three large     story buildings are  That s the beginning of down town  I  saw that burned automobile there  completely burned  only metal remained  I  couldn t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets  Later I was told it  was a Zhiguli  And the people in there were completely incinerated  Nothing  remained of them  not even any traces  That driver had told me about it  and I saw the car myself  The car was there  The skeleton  a metallic carcass  About    to    yards from the Kavkaz store   I see a military transport  an armored personnel carrier  The hatches are closed  And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it  the crowd is  And I hear shots  not automatic fire  it s true  but pistol shots  Several shots  There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier   Someone in the crowd was shooting  Apparently they either wanted to kill the  soldiers or get a machine gun or something  At that point there was only one  armored personnel carrier  And all the tanks were outside the city  cordoning  off Sumgait   I walked on  I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant  I can tell by  their gait that they re not bandits  they re just people  walking home  I joined them so in case something happened  in case someone came up to us and asked questions  either of us would be in a position to answer  you see  But I avoided the large groups because I m a local and might be quickly  recognized  I tried to keep at a distance  and walked where there were fewer people  Well so I walked into Microdistrict    which is across from our block  I can t get into our block  but I walked where there were fewer people  so as  to get around  Well there I see a tall guy and    to    people are walking  behind him  And he s shouting into a megaphone   Comrades  the Armenian  Azerbaijani war has begun    The police have megaphones like that  So they re talking and walking around  the second microdistrict  I see that they re coming my way  and turn off  behind a building  I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings   and inside the microdistricts there were about   or   people standing on every corner  and at the middles of the buildings  and at the edges  What they were  doing I can t say  because I couldn t get up close to them  I was afraid  But  the most important thing was to get away from there  to get home  and at least find out if my children were alive or not           April             Yerevan  \\t\\t           reference

              " '   Assuming   Also  come on  Brad  If we are going to get anywhere in  this  or any  discussion  it doesn t help to bring up elements I never  addressed   nor commented on in any way   I made no comment on who is   right  or who is  wrong   only that civilians ARE being used as cover  and that  having been placed  in between  the Israelis and the guerillas  they  will  be injured as both parties continue their fight    \\t The  purpose  of an army s use of military uniforms  \\tis  to set its members apart  from the civilians so that  \\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as \\t combatants   So  what do you think is the  meaning behind    \\tthe intention and the effect when an  army  purposely  \\t does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to  look  \\tlike civilians    They are judging that the benefit they will  \\treceive from this  cover  is more important that the harm \\tthat will come to civilians    This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas  do  have some responsibility in putting civilians in  the middle  of this fight  By putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians  barracks  etc    the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians   \\tBut if the guerillas do this aren t  they  putting themselves \\tat greater risk  Absolutely  they ask themselves  why set  \\tourselves apart  by wearing uniforms  when there is a ready made  \\tcover for us  civilians   That makes sense from their point of  \\tview  BUT when this cover is used  the guerillas should accept  \\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians    I agree with you here  I have always thought that Israel s bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid  thoughtless  inhumane AND ineffective  BUT  there is no reason that Israel should passive wait  until attackers chose to act  there is every reason to believe that  taking the fight  to  the enemy  will do more to stop attacks    As I said previously  Israel spent several decades  sitting passively  on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks  after  the attackers had entered Israeli territory  It didn t work very well  The  host  Arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks  from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher  as was their physical and psychological impact  on the civilians caught in their path     This is just another  selectively applied  statement    The reason for this drawn out impasse between Ababs Palestinians and Israelis is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other  By your criteria  everyone  should stay away from the negotiations   That is precisely why the Palestinians  in their recent PISGA proposal for  the  interim  period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy  are demanding conditions that essentially define  autonomy  already  They DO NOT trust that Israel will  follow through  the entire process and allow Palestinians to reach full autonomy    Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians   If you do  then why should Israel s view of Arabs Palestinians  be any different  Why should they trust the Arab Palestinians  words  Since they don t  they are VERY reluctant to give up  tangible assets   land  control of areas  in exchange for  words   For this reason  they are also concerned about the sorts of  guarantees  they will have  that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached   Absolutely  so are the Arabs Palestinians asking FIRST for the Israelis  word  in relation to any agreement  NO  what is being demanded FIRST is LAND  When the issue is LAND  and one party finally gets HOLD of this  land   what the  other party  does is totally irrelevent  If I NOW have possession of this land  your words have absolutely no power  whether Israel chooses to keeps its word does NOT get the land back    While the  major armaments   those allowing people to wage  civil wars   have been removed  the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent  Rocket attacks still continue  and  commando  raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life  yours of that of others   Such attacks also continue    Bat guano  The situation you call for existed in the     s and attacks were commonplace    There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively  disarmed  UNLESS the state is as authoritarian is Syria s  The only other way is for Lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel  essentially mirroring Israel s border secirity on its side  It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory   That s what I said  ok  But  doesn t that mean that Syria has to  take over  Lebanon  I don t think Israel or Lebanon would like that  What both  sides  need is to receive something  tangible   The Arabs  Palestinians are looking for  land  and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to Israel  Israel has two problems     if it gives up real  land  it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation  and that change doesn t help Israel s position   and    WHEN it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks',\n",

immortality   The basic idea behind  digital immortality  is that computer networks    are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever   The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future   Perhaps they ll be put in different formats  perhaps only surviving on backup tapes    but they ll be there   and someone will dig them up      If that doesn t interest you    OTIS also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works    a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors   Suddenly  life is  breathed into your work   and by merit of it s stimulus  it will  travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons    Spectators are welcome also  feel free to browse the gallery and  let the artists know what you think of their efforts   Keep your own copies of the images to look at when you ve got the gumption    that s what they re here for                                                                    WHERE                OTIS currently  as of          has two FTP sites       \\t

then either FTP put it in the CONTRIB Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me  email addresses at eof  in email   After the image is received  it will be put into the correct directory   Computer originated works are also welcome   OTIS  directories house two types of image files  GIF and JPG    GIF and JPG files require  oddly enough  a GIF or JPG viewer to  see   These viewers are available for all types of computers at  most large FTP sites around Internet   JPG viewers are a bit tougher to find   If you can t find one  but do have a GIF viewer    you can obtain a JPG to GIF conversion program which will change     JPG files to a standard GIF format    OTIS also accepts animation files         When you submit image files  please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used  in publications or other projects  or if it is merely for people to view   Also  include some biographical information on yourself  we ll be having info files on each contributing artist and their works   You  can also just upload a text file of info about yourself  instead of  emailing    If you have pictures  but no scanner  there is hope   Merely send copies to   The OTIS Project c o Ed Stastny PO BX        Omaha  NE             I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will   scan them   Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back    Also include information on each image  preferably a     line  description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it s finally put   If you have preferences as to what the images are to be named  include those as well      Conversely  if you have a scanner and would like to help out  please contact me and we ll arrange things   If you want to submit your works by disk  peachy   Merely send a      disk to the above address  Omaha  and a SASE if you want your disk back  This is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or FTP  but do have access to a scanner   We accept disks in either Mac or IBM compatible format   If possible  please submit image files as GIF or JPG   If you can t   we can convert from most formats   we d just rather not have to   At senders request  we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they can stand   Even if you don t have stuff to contribute  you can send a blank disk and an

                                                          DISTRIBUTION   The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely    on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way  save to convert from one image format to another    In fact  we encourage files to be distributed to local  bulletin boards and such   If you could  please transport the appropriate text files along with the images      It would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from OTIS to your local bbs   I just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is   It s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as possible   If you have the time  please upload a few to your favorite BBS system    or even just post this  info file  there   It would be keen of you                                                                         USE   If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory  you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the  stipulations of the permission  such as free copy of publication  or full address credit    You will either find this in the   rm  file for     the image or series of images   or in the  Artists  directory under the  Artists name   If permission isn t explicitly given  then you ll have  to contact the artist to ask for it   If no info is available  email me  ed cwis unomaha edu   and I ll get in contact with the artist for  you  or give you their contact information    When you DO use permitted work  it s always courteous to let the artist know about it  perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files                                                                          NAMING IMAGES   Please keep the names of your files in  dos  format   That means  keep the filename  before  jpg or  gif  to eight characters or less   The way I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist  plus a three or four digit  code  for the series of images  plus the series number  Thus  Leonardo DeVinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like    \\tldmek  gif     OR    ldmek  jpg    OR    ldmech  gif   ETC  Keeping the names under   characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems                                                                               CREATING IMAGE FILES   When creating image files  be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture   This gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you   You may also want to include a title  address or other information you d like people to know                                                                            HMMM    That s

              " 'I differ with our moderator on this   I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us  subject to sin and death   as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer        puts it  was that Jesus was tempted  but did not succumb   If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity  then Jesus  fully human   Nicea  would not be  subject to sin   but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning  because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin   To distinguish between  human  and  fallen human  makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most    First  the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius s version    they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him   Second  the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his  successful  opponents  who wrote the conventional history  claimed   Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary  arguing  I think correctly  that a human could not be called Mother of God   I mean  in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son  uncreate     surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary   Anyway  Nestorius s opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos  that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus  which would require two seperate and distinct natures   The argument fails though  because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus  who preexisted her either divinely  if you accept  Nestorianism  as commonly defined  or both natures intertwined  a la Chalcedon   Second  I am not sure that  Nestorianism  is not a better alternative than the orthodox view   After all  I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnation that Jesus s human nature was in heaven  likewise post Ascension   I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him   It was a seperate nature  capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane  since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted  but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed   Comments on the above warmly appreciated   Jason Albert   There may be differences in what we mean by  subject to sin    The original complaint was from someone who didn t see how we could call Jesus fully human  because he didn t sin   I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation   I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing  he is thereby not fully human   I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human   I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism   I agree with you  and have said elsewhere  that there s reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical   There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian   I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents  I thought he got the better of them   However  most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance  and that Nestorius was at the very least  rash and dogmatic   as the editor of  The Christological Controversy  refers to him  in rejecting all approaches other than his own   As regular Usenet readers know  narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong   Furthermore  he did say some things that I think are problematical   He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet   In it he says  To attribute also to  the Logos   in the name of  the incarnation  the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him     is  my brother  either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others   Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound  because of it  to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness      These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood    It s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity   But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have  to some degree  a part in being born  growing up  and dying   Of course it must be understood that there s a certain indirectness in the Logos  participation in these things   But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human  or we don t have an incarnation at all   Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms  and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area   You say  I find it hard to believe that pre Incarnation that Jesus s human nature was in heaven    I don t think that s required by orthodox doctrine   It s the divine Logos that is eternal ',\n",

of your s is a perfect example of what an intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are  since I specifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreaty to spread the word   In fact  it is the combination of the two statements I was addressing  and not just the one  and for you to characterize that as  ignoring  the instruction to spread the word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are    Of course  Matt        quoted above  makes no mention of  instruction to spread the word    All these quotes btw are from   Message ID       Apr               cbnewsj cb att com    And I claim it correctly  because my question went    Do you  too  measure the goodness of a post by its entertainment value  and care not a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood    and the closest Dean came to an answer was    Peter  Peter  Peter   You re just so stupid  pretentious  dull  and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that the sport is all there is    Of course  this does NOT answer my question  which has to do with posts in GENERAL and not my posts in particular   Surely even Dean knows this  yet he brazenly asserts otherwise  reinforcing his claim with an insult    So I now restore the answer to your question that you deleted   If you re still unable to figure it out  ask a nice kid at the local junior high to help you   It really doesn t take much sophistication to understand    On top of which  I doubt that the  answer  is at all representative of Dean s true frame of mind   The insults you have seen quoted thus far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean s  mind throughout the     line post from which these quotes were taken  One wonders whether Dean s mind is so warped as to find sport in all this   He even dredges up a falsified account of events that transpired earlier on another thread    You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it \\t\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ the  sins  of other individuals   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  False   I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one s sins  That I made public announcements of the  sins  of others    sins   BTW  that were a matter of public record  documented in the posts of others   is a different matter   Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins  so I pointed some of them out   And I expressly set up a whole thread  YOUR TURN  to let people point out MY sins to me   Dean again    You made an ass of yourself by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was somehow an attempt to  paint Jews as plaster saints   thereby revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well as showing your dislike for people saying positive things about Jews  and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made  and then claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge    Actually  what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite according to Jewish customs   In doing so  he was caricaturing Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding  as well as implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity   I went very easily on Dean for this  giving him the benefit of the doubt in a post following my initial crack about  plaster saints    suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording   In an astonishing act of ingratitude  Dean now serves up an incredibly distorted picture of what took place between us  and using it as the basis of one insult

individuals whose contributions I just received   John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again  thank you to all who gave   I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product   Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems    It runs under Windows     and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners     When initially bringing up the software  it lets you select several options       text   graphics     input source ie scanner  fax file  disk file      automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image    I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned  and in what order   Once an image is scanned  you can bring up the Pop Up image verification   The  software gives you two  errors  at this point   Blue which are words that were  converted reliability  but do not match anything in the built in dictionary    Yellow shade  which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn t think it converted  correctly at all   I have found that the software should give itself more  credit   It is usually correct  instead of wrong   If a word is shaded blue   you can add it to your personal dictionary   The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about     words   I find this to be very limited   considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary    After a document is converted  you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats   Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format   I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files   I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter

received in  standard  mode     x    dpi   the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent    Overall  a very impressive product   The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary       specialized words is just  too small    If anyone has any specific questions  please do not hesitate to send me email                                      HICNet Medical Newsletter

earlier this century that infectious diseases would  soon be eliminated as a public health problem      infectious diseases remain  the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in  the United States  Since the early     s  the U S  public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes  e g    Escherichia coli O    H   hepatitis C virus  human immunodeficiency virus   Legionnaires disease  Lyme disease  and toxic shock syndrome   The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control  such as cholera   malaria  and tuberculosis  TB   have increased in many areas  Furthermore   control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea  malaria  pneumococcal disease   salmonellosis  shigellosis  TB  and staphylococcal infections      Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons  those  in institutional settings  e g   hospitals and child day care centers   and  minority and underserved populations  The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U S  health care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs             This issue of MMWR introduces a new series   Emerging Infectious  Diseases   Future articles will address these diseases  as well as  surveillance  control  and prevention efforts by health care providers and  public health officials  This first article updates the ongoing investigation  of

bacterium first  identified as a cause of illness in      during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers      This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS  the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children  Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef  although other  food vehicles  including roast beef  raw milk  and apple cider  also have been  implicated      Preliminary data from a CDC   year  nationwide  multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E  coli O    H   that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of     participating hospitals and was isolated from      of all bloody stools  a  higher rate than for any other pathogen        Infection with E  coli O    H  often is not recognized because most  clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page    Volume     Number                                              April           SMAC medium  and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses  associated with infection      The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea   often bloody  and abdominal cramps  fever is infrequent  Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications  Illness usually resolves after     days  but       of patients  develop HUS  which is characterized by hemolytic anemia  thrombocytopenia   renal failure  and a death rate of              This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E  coli O    H  in the absence of routine surveillance  Despite  the magnitude of this outbreak  the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington       Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E  coli O    H  using SMAC agar       When infections with E  coli O    H  are identified  they should be reported  to local health departments for further evaluation and  if necessary  public  health action to prevent further cases        E  coli O    H  lives in the intestines of healthy cattle  and can  contaminate meat during slaughter  CDC is collaborating with the U S   Department of Agriculture s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E  coli O    H  entering the meat supply   Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens  and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior  ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated  The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink  and the juices  are clear  In this outbreak  undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role  The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to      F       C   FDA  personal communication               Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks  The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E  coli O    H  and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E   coli O    H     References     CDC  Preliminary report  foodborne outbreak of Escherichia coli O    H   infections from hamburgers   western United

nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer        the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently       To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products   CDC s      National Health Interview Survey Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement  NHIS HPDP  collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U S  civilian   noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to    years  This  report summarizes findings from this survey        The      NHIS HPDP supplement asked  Have you used snuff at least     times in your entire life   and  Do you use snuff now   Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking  Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least    times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview  former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least    times and not using either at the  time of the interview  Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users  Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least     cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least     cigarettes and who were not  smoking now  Ever smokers included current and former smokers  Data on  smokeless tobacco use were

Statistics  National  Center for Health Statistics  CDC    Editorial Note  The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless  tobacco was highest among young males  Adolescent and young adult males  in  particular  are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility  Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players  encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction  oral cancer  and other mouth disorders            Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation  For example  targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups  and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons              In this report  one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes  In the      NHIS HPDP

              " 'Note  These trial updates are summarized from reports in the _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television station  KTVB Channel     Randy Weaver Kevin Harris trial update  Day     Friday  April          was the fourth day of the trial   Synopsis  Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross examined agent Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald Howen   Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied   The day was marked by a caustic cross examination of Deputy Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence   Although Spence has not explicitly stated so  one angle of his stategy must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper   Cooper is the government s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan  Spence attacked Cooper s credibility by pointing out discrepancies between Cooper s statements last September and those made in court  Cooper conceded that   You have all these things compressed into a few seconds   It s difficult to remember what went on first    Cooper acknowledged that he carried a   mm Colt Commando submachine gun with a silenced barrel    I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver   Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver s dog   When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan s M    rifle when Degan was apparently dead  Cooper could not say for sure that Degan did not return fire before going down   Spence continued by asking with how many agents  and to what extent  had Cooper discussed last August s events  Cooper responded   If you re implying that we got our story together  you re wrong  counselor    Spence continued to advance the defense s version of the events  Namely  that a marshal had started the shooting by killing the Weaver s dog   Cooper disagreed   Assistant U S  Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence s virulent cross examination of agent Cooper  arguing that the questions were repetitive and Spence was wasting time   Howen also complained  that Spence was improperly using a cross examination to advance the defense s version of the events   U S  District Judge Edward Lodge sustained many of the objections  however  both lawyers persisted until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to admonish both attorneys    I m not going to play games with either counsel   This has been a personality problem from day    so start acting like professionals    Spence told the judge that   When all the evidence is in  we ll see that     his  agent Larry Cooper  testimony is not credible  that he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events    Spence continued   We re going to find   that there is a very unlikely similarity   almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter   between the testimony of Mr  Cooper and the other witnesses    Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen s repeated objections would prevent a fair trial   We can t have a fair trial if the jury believes I m some sort of charlatan  if the jury believes I m bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I m violating court orders    Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen s objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was  preposterous  and denied the motion for a mistrial   Lodge did tell Howen to restrict his comments when objecting   The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton   The prosecution s purpose was simply to introduce five weapons found in the cabin as evidence  However  the defense seized on the opportunity to further address Cooper s credibility   Defense attorney Ellison Matthews  Harris  other attorney  questioned Rampton about the dog   Rampton stated that there were no specific plans to kill the Weaver s dog without being detected   Matthews then had Rampton read  a Septtember          transcript in which Rampton had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon was to kill the dog without being detected  if the dog chased them  Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that  but he could not remember when   He then stated that   I did not conduct the primary interview with Deputy Cooper  but I have had conversations with him since the interview was conducted  ',\n",

crypt  sci answers  and news answers  every    days    Contents     What is the National Security Agency  NSA     What are the US export regulations    What is TEMPEST    What are the Beale Ciphers  and are they a hoax    What is the American Cryptogram Association  and how do I get in touch    Is RSA patented    What about the Voynich manuscript      What is the National Security Agency  NSA      The NSA is the official security body of the U S  government  It   was given its charter by President Truman in the late    s  and   has continued research in cryptology till the present  The NSA is   known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world    and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the   world  Governments in general have always been prime employers of   cryptologists  The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many   years ahead of the public state of the art  and can undoubtedly break   many of the systems used in practice  but for reasons of national   security almost all information about the NSA is classified     Bamford s book  BAMFD  gives a history of the people and operations of   the NSA  The following quote from Massey  MAS    highlights the   difference between public and private research in cryptography           if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government    one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted   behind closed doors  Without doubt  the number of workers engaged   today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of   those engaged in open research in cryptology  For only about      years has there in fact been widespread open research in   cryptology  There have been  and will continue to be  conflicts   between these two research communities  Open research is common   quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open   exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in   scholarly journals  But can a government agency  charged with   responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations    countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break  Can   a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might   undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers    One might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would   force all governments to behave like Stimson s  gentlemen   but one   must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with   political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most   scientific fields  The wonder is not that some conflicts have   occurred between government agencies and open researchers in   cryptology  but rather that these conflicts  at least those of which   we are aware  have been so few and so mild       What are the US export regulations     In a nutshell  there are two government agencies which control   export of encryption software  One is the Bureau of Export   Administration  BXA  in the Department of Commerce  authorized by   the Export Administration Regulations  EAR   Another is the Office   of Defense Trade Controls  DTC  in the State Department  authorized   by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations  ITAR   As a rule   of thumb  BXA  which works with COCOM  has less stringent   requirements  but DTC  which takes orders from NSA  wants to see   everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA     The newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting   discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export  what   people think about those laws  and many other complex issues which   go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci crypt  Make sure to   consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in   jail  if you are lucky  your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at   least heard of the ITAR     What is TEMPEST     TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer   equipment  It was created in response to the discovery that   information can be read from computer radiation  e g   from a CRT  at   quite a distance and with little effort     Needless to say  encryption doesn t do much good if the cleartext   is available this way     What are the Beale Ciphers  and are they a hoax      Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for   corrections      The story in a pamphlet by J  B  Ward        goes  Thomas   Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass   of treasure and buried it in Bedford County  Virginia  leaving   three ciphers with an innkeeper  the ciphers describe the   location  contents  and intended beneficiaries of the treasure    Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher  contents  called B     it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the   Declaration of Independence  DOI  as key  B  and B  are unsolved    many documents have been tried as the key to B      Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B  by various   means with an eye toward splitting the treasure     The Beale Cypher Association   P O  Box       Beaver Falls  PA          You can get the ciphers from the rec puzzles FAQL by including the   line     send index    in a message to netlib peregrine com and following the directions     There are apparently several different versions of the cipher   floating around  The correct version is based on the      pamphlet    says John King  kingj hpcc   corp hp com       Some believe the story is a hoax  Kruh  KRU    gives a long list of   problems with the story  Gillogly  GIL    decrypted B  with the DOI   and found some unexpected strings  including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP    Hammer  president of the Beale Cypher Association  agrees that this   string couldn t appear by chance  but feels there must be an   explanation  Gwyn  sci crypt expert  is unimpressed with this   string     What is the American Cryptogram Association  and how do I get in touch     The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography  with an emphasis   on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with   pencil and paper or computers  Its organ   The Cryptogram   includes   articles

________________________________________________________                                     So that the                                   Prophecy be                                    Fulfilled                                                     In considering the Christian religion  and judging it according to its claims  it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy   The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth   As you will see  Matthew s main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages  often not even about the promised Messiah  and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament   We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts   Since the gospels were written at least    years after Jesus was executed  we do not know how much happened exactly as stated   But  for purposes of analysis  we will take particular claims at face value   Immanuel          We begin  of course  at the beginning           Mt              Mary  will bear a son  and you         Joseph  will name him  Jesus   which means G d is        salvation   for he will save his people from their        sins    All this happened to fulfil what the lord had        spoken by a prophet           Isaiah           In the days of Ahaz  c      BCE          king of Judah  Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made        war on Jerusalem  capitol of Judah   but could not        quite conquer it   When the house of David  i e  Ahaz        and his court in Judah  were told of this     its        heart and the heart of its people shook      And  the        lord G d said to Isaiah   go to meet with Ahaz                And the lord spoke to Ahaz  through prophet Isaiah         naturally  saying   Ask a sign of G d your lord   It        can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven    But         Ahaz said   I won t ask  I will not put the lord to a        test    Then  Isaiah  said   Hear then  O house of        David   Is it not enough for you to weary men  that        you must weary my god too   Therefore  the lord        himself will give you a sign   Behold  a young woman        is with child and will bear a son  and name him         Immanuel   which means   G d is with us     He will        eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil        and choose good   For  before the child knows how to        refuse evil and choose good  the land of the two kings        you dread will have been deserted     Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics   Further  he the Hebrew word  almah    young woman   as specifically   virgin    But  this is not a prophecy about the Messiah   It is not a prophecy about an event to happen     years later   It is not a prophecy about a virgin  bethulah  mother   In short  it not about Jesus   Matthew has made use of a verse out of context  and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary   It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner  a very general one  it can be made to fit Mary   Mary  virgin or not  was indeed a young woman with child   Of course  the fit is shady and has problems   Jesus  while thought of by later Christians to be G d walking among men  was never called by the name  Immanuel   If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus  it becomes at best a cut and paste prophecy    a second class prophecy    Not too convincing   Egypt          After Jesus s birth in Bethlehem  Matthew tells about a quick  and elsewhere unmentioned  excursion to Egypt  as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses   This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king  Herod           Mt           and remained there until the death of        Herod   This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken          Out of Egypt I have cal led my son     What the lord really said was this           Hosea        When Israel was a child  I loved him          And  out of Egypt I called my son   The more I called        them  my people   the more they went from me  they        kept sacrificing to the Ba als  and kept burning        incense to idols   Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea s oracle   But  it was indeed Israel that  once called out of Egypt  wanted to return   This is history   Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here   And  if we are to draw some kind of parallel here  we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G d    Again  this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped   Rachel Weeps           While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt  Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him  and thus ordered the executions of all young male children   Matthew then writes           Mt            By this  that which was spoken by the        prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled           A voice was heard in Ramah  wailing and loud        lamentation   Rachel weeping for her children         she refused to be consoled  because they were        no more       The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah        referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon  of Assyria  in     BCE   Rachel  the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel  Ephraim  and Manasseh  is said to weep for her descendants who are  no more    It is metaphorical  of course  since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile         It is interesting to note that it was Leah  not Rachel  who was the ancestor of the Judeans  the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were    If anyone should do weeping for her  children   it is Leah   The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city   on the way to Ephrath   Bethlehem           As for Herod and his infanticide  it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred   One never knows  but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible  nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time   Herod was particularly unliked in his reign  and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded   This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus s life to enhance the message of the church s gospel         Because of the whole story s similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt  it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic  yet artificial  approval of Jesus  It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote    The  children  the prophet speaks of are not dead  but exiled in the Assyrian Empire   G d comforts the weeping Rachel  saying that the children will be returned   he will gather them back together   Of course  this would not suit Matthew s purpose  as the children he speaks of are dead for good   Again  the  prophecy  Matthew sets up is not even that  and to anyone who bothers to check it out  is not too convincing   The Nazarene          We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy   After leaving Egypt  Joseph   wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth            Mt           that what was spoken of by the prophets        might be fulfilled   He shall be called a Nazarene    First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet s  this time   Second  we have to ask who  He  is   There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene   Worse  there are no prophecies  period  mentioning a Nazarene   Still worse  there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all   In the book of Judges  an angel tells Samson s mother that she will           Judges            conceive and bear a son   No razor        shall tough his head  for he will be a Nazirite to his        god from the day of his birth   He will deliver Israel        from the hands of the Philistines    This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus  or the messiah of G d   But  it is the best that can be found   Obviously  Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies  in that he is simple making them up now   Bearing our Diseases          Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities           Mt         This was to fulfil what was spoken by the        prophet Isaiah   He took our infirmities and bore our        diseases    As expected  the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context  and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme   We have           Is        Surely he   the suffering servant   has        borne our sickness  and carried our pains   From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah  we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel  Jehovah s chosen servant and people   He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile  in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it   This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity   an image of a chastised  yet cherished  Israel as the instrument of the nations  salvation by G d        The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline   They do not speak of a  servant  going around and healing people   Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations  and individual Jews    Jesus  as we all know  did not take the diseases onto himself   The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come  but rather something that had already happened   While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell  he did not bear the illnesses he healed   So  while someone might want to say that  figuratively  Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement  he has to admit that Matthew s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect    Silent Messiah         Upon healing multitudes of commoners  it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet  presumable so that he wouldn t arouse the attention of the local rulers           Mt            This was to fulfill what was spoken by        the prophet Isaiah              Behold my servant whom I have chosen  my beloved         with whom my soul is pleased   I will put my spirit on        him  and he will announce justice to the Gentiles   He        will not wrangle or cry aloud  nor will anyone hear        his voice in the streets   He will not break a bruised        reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings        justice to victory  and the gentiles will hope in his        name    The Isaiah passage quoted reads           Is          Behold my servant whom I uphold  my        chosen  in whom my soul delights   I have put my        spirit on him  and he will bring forth justice to the        nations   We will not cry or lift up his voice  or        make it heard in the street   He will not break a        bruised reed  or quench a smoldering wick   He will        faithfully bring forth justice   He will not fail         burn dimly  or be discouraged  bruised  until he has        established justice in the earth   And the coastlands        await his law   You see  Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage  because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus   Christians could never think of Jesus failing  never would the  light  of mankind burn dimly   But  the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done   When the gentiles come to embrace G d there will no longer be a chosen people  but rather all will be the children of G d   Also  the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic     the coastlands await his law   to the Christologic   the Gentiles will hope in his name     While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah  the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of  believing in the name    If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus  one has only to read the whole chapter  Isaiah     and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant   a people robbed and plundered       So  we see that when Matthew s attempt at  prophecy  is examined  it crumbles   Three Days and Three Nights         Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself   He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection           Mt          For as Jonah was in the belly of the        whale for three days and three nights  so will the Son        of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and        three nights   Before any further discussion can occur  it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days   As far as day names went  each was    hours long  lasting from sunset  pm to the following sunset  pm   What was referred to as a  day  was the period of light from  am to the ending sunset at  pm   Thus  according to our time scale  a sabbath day began at  pm Friday evening  and lasted until  pm saturday evening   This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays  instead of Sundays    It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn t forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week    Thus  when days and nights are referred to together     hour daylight portions and    hour night periods are being spoken of   Thus  Jesus says that he will be in the grave  or in hell  or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights         As the good book tells us  Jesus was crucified on the  ninth hour   which is  pm  Friday afternoon   He then was put into the grave sometime after that   Then  Jesus left the grave   rose   before dawn of what we call Sunday  The dawn after the sabbath was over    What this means is that Jesus was  using our time for clarity  in the grave from  pm Friday night to some time before  am Sunday morning   We could also add a little time before  pm Friday  since the bible is not specific here   What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day  two nights  and possibly a couple of hours of one day   Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction   There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights   even using modern time measurements    We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew s little mistakes  and that the gospel writer put false words into his god s mouth    And no matter who made the prediction  it is more than unconvincing    it is counter convincing   Hearing   Understanding        Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables   stories in which a deeper meaning could be found  if you were already one of the elect  those chosen to understand the message of Jesus   He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants   If the people cannot understand them  there is no need to bother with them  since they will not accept the  plain  message any better   Matthew says           Mt            With them  the audience  indeed in        fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says            You will indeed hear but never understand  and you        will indeed see  but never perceive   Because this        people s heart has grown dull  their ears are heavy of        hearing  and they have shut their eyes so the they        would not perceive with them  her with their ears  and        understand with their heart  and turn for me to heal        them    The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works  his call to the ministry   This is in     BCE  when Israel is flourishing  right before it falls under the authority of Assyria   Isaiah sees the good times ending  and also a vision from G d  calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah           Is          And G d said   Go  and say to this        people   Hear and hear  but do not understand  see and        see  but do not perceive     Make the heart of this        people fat  make their ears heavy  and shut their        eyes  so they will not see with their eyes  or hear        with their ears  and understand with their hearts  and        turn and be healed    Then Isaiah said   How long         lord    And he said   Until the cities lie waste        without inhabitant  and houses without men  and the        land is utterly desolate  and the G ds take men far        away  and forsaken places are many in the land   And        though a tenth will remain in it  it will be burned        again  like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still        stands when the tree is felled   The holy seed is its        stump   Here we see that it is really G d who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet s warnings  but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon s  and David s  seed lineage   If you read the rest of Isaiah  you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G d to use Israel as a servant  a light to the nations    Look at Isaiah                             We see that Matthew has cut and pasted just a little portion of Isaiah s verse  to suit his own gospel needs   More than that  he has altered the words  to make it fit the people who didn t understand Jesus s stories   And  as we see  Isaiah s verses are not prophecies  but rather commands from G d to him  in the present    Once again  Matthew s prophecy falls flat on its face         Matthew tries again to make Jesus s parables look like they have the prophetic approval           Mt            he said nothing to them without a        parable   This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the        prophet   I will open my mouth to them in parables   I        will utter that which has been hidden since the        foundation of the world    Matthew really botches up here   He attempts to quote not from a prophet  but from the Psalms           Ps          I will open my mouth in parable   I will        utter dark sayings of old  things that we all have        heard and known  things that our fathers have told us          We will not hide them from their children  but tell to        the coming generation the glorious deeds of the        lord     As was pointed out  the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet   You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew s gospel even inserted Isaiah s name as this prophet   Apparently  later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up       Perhaps the most significant part of this is that  once again  Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures   As Jesus has said earlier  he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them   The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden   Further  they speak of things  known  that our fathers have told us    Jesus deals with things  hidden since the foundation of the world    Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion   This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms   No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them    And still once again  Matthew s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face   But  Christians rarely look at this   Matthew s prophecies aren t the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad    Excuses of Little Faith          In Mt            we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons  except in one case   Not knowing what epilepsy was  the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons   It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to  dispossess  the epileptic   But  Jesus  perhaps no more enlightened than they  is reported to have rebuked them  saying they didn t have enough faith    This seems strange   Why was this demon special   It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not   Apparently  enough faith will allow someone to move mountains   Of course  you will find no one  these days that can move real mountains   No one parts seas   The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place   Major miracles are making some old woman s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T V          And the gods  including Jesus  are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings  protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts   They are either dead  sleeping  or hiding in heaven  with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone   Yet  life goes on          Tales of mystics  stories of miracles   all in a distant time or a distant place   Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days  Jehovah too   But  now they are silent   All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don t get to see God anymore          We re too lazy  we re not zealous enough  we re        sinful  it s just his  plan   we put too many of our        own demands on G d s appearance  if we had the right        faith  if we  were willing to meet G d on his terms          Yet  even the most pious of men have not seen G d   You  dear reader  have not seen G d   Not literally  you know that to be true   I know that s presumptuous and bold   But  searching your heart  you know what I mean    All that we ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G d   They say our little faith does not merit us to see G d   Sometimes  they say   See the love in these people you worship with    see the lives of people change    that is seeing G d     Thus people get lulled to sleep  satisfied with turning G d into the everyday sights    But  that is not seeing G d as I am speaking of    it is not seeing G d the way people used to see          What we see in the world that is good  is the compassion of human hearts  the love given and taken by men and women  the forgiveness practised by Christian   Atheist alike  beauty created by the mind of man   These are the things that are done  these are what we see   But  it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith  \\x0c Jesus Rides on an Ass          Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king  Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem             Mt        This took place to fulfil what was spoken        by the prophet  saying          Tell the daughter of Zion   Behold  your king is        coming to you  humble  mounted on an ass  and on a        ass colt    Of course  the passage quoted from Zechariah     reads a little differently          Lo  your king comes to you  he is triumphant and        victorious  humble  and riding on an ass  on an ass         colt    he will command peace to the nations   There isn t all that much difference here  except that Zechariah only involves one animal    an ass colt    while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently   Thus  he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass   From Matthew s version  we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys   This could inevitably lead to a theological  proctological dilemma    We find that in the account written earlier by St  Mark  only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus   This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly  and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses  he has bungled   Now  excluding many respectable Christians I have met  I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses  the situation is often reversed nowadays            Then  entering the Jerusalem temple  the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah   But  Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done           Mt         Haven t you read    Out of the mouth of        babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise    It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little  prophetic  things AND since  as we might expect  the quote is in error  which seems to fit Matthew s track record quite well   We might ask Jesus or Matthew   Haven t you read   for the source reads           Psalms         O YaHWeH our lord  how majestic is        your name in the whole world    You  whose glory is        chanted above the heavens by babes and infants  you        have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the        enemy and the avenger   The passages hardly need comment   There is no  perfect praise  spoken of in the psalm  and what praise is there is given to G d  not his messiah king  and not Jesus   As mentioned  it seems to be just one more case of Matthew s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture   YHVH said to  my lord            Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah king is to be descended   The Jews agree   it is king David   But  then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms               The LORD said to my Lord  sit at my right hand  until        I put your enemies under your feet    Taken at face value  Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent   One assumes he is in opposition to their answer   Of course  the Christian answer is that he agrees  but is trying to make some hidden point  to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah king   It s tempting to believe this  if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation   But  there are problems         In Jesus s time  the psalm was thought to be about the messiah   And  it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior   We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king  bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David s rule   Of course  the Jews listening had no good answer  and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah  such as the Christians worship   The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm  an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus s time had also made   One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews  often as a result of different expectations of the messiah king   Jesus was apparently one of these adventists  like his audience  who thought the messiah s advent was imminent  and who interpreted Psalms      among others  as being messianic  What is the problem  then   Psalm     literally reads          YHVH s utterance to my lord  \\t Sit at my right hand  until I make your enemies your        footstool           YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion   Rule        in the midst of your foes   Your people will offer        themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the        holy mountains             You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek        forever    The word  lord  is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord   But  in the Hebrew  the word is  adoni   and no capitalisation exists   Adoni simply means  lord   a generic term as we would use it   It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G d   It is merely an address of respect          There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah king   That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain   The title of the psalm translates to either  a psalm of David   or  a psalm about David    It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet  about David s covenant and endorsement from G d   If the psalm had been written by David  it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah   The idea of a perfect king  descended from David  was not present in David s age   We have extensive tales of David s doings and sayings   none of which include any praises of a messiah       Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead  in times of the exile when G d had put his show of favour for David s kingdom on hold         The description in the psalm fit David very well   David was promised by G d a rise to power  victory over his enemies  successful judgement among the nations he conquered   He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king  enabled to bless the people    It all fits        We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone  though   Here  there is not artificial prophecy alluded to  though his use of the scripture is rather questionable   Still  this event is common to the other gospels too   So  we let Matthew off a little more easily this time   It is interesting to note  though  how Matthew dresses up the event   The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd   Matthew has the Pharisees  who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity  be the target of Jesus s question   As we might expect  Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees   Such power is the pen   Moses   Jesus  Had it Together All Along             We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in John s gospel   The gospel story of John deserves special treatment  because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus s career as told by even Matthew   But  for the moment  we will just look at one verse   The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king  and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G d   When constructing the history of Abraham  Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people   While this was accomplished eventually  under the rule of king David  the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise   But  to do so  they expanded on the promise  preaching about a heavenly kingdom           John        J C  speaking  Your father  Abraham         rejoiced to see My day   He say it and was glad   It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham  but  Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah  or anything Christian   I have tried  and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John s little prophecy   It is par for the course to see St  John making up Old Testament backings  just like his forerunner Matthew   Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud  and it is surprising they still cling to it   The Potter s Field         We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers  Judas Iscariot    Matthew writes           Mt           And throwing down the pieces of silver        in the temple   Judas  departed    But  the chief        priests  taking the silver  said   It isn t lawful for        us to put it in the treasury  since it is blood        money    So they    bought a potter s field with it to        bury strangers in    Then was fulfilled what was        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah           And they took the thirty pieces of silver  the price        of him on whom a price had been set by some of the        sons of Israel  and they gave them for the potter s        field  as the lord directed me    This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture   First  Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet   It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of           Zech                And they weighed out my wages         thirty shekels of silver   Then YHVH said to me   Cast        them to the treasury     the lordly price at which I        was paid off by them   So I took the thirty shekels of        silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of        YHVH   First of all  the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah  or of G d   The deal with a shepherd  most likely a priest  chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another   The word   treasury   had been replaced by the King James Scholars with  to the potter   precisely because this made Matthew s quote fit better   But  this is a blatant error   The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed  treasury   which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah s context  whereas  potter s field  is totally unrelated   Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation   However  given Matthew s track record  one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty        Of course  Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text   The thirty pieces of silver match Judas s situation  and if as most Christians seem to be  the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity  Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around   However  the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests   The high priests would not put the money in the treasury   The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite   Of course  to the average Thursday Night Bible student  the  prophecy  as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value   To those  Matthew s work is convincing enough   Wine  Vinegar    Casting Lots         Then  Jesus is led away to be crucified           Mt               they gave him vinegar to drink         mingled with gall  but when he tasted it  he would not        drink it   And  when they had crucified him  they        divided his garments among them by casting lots  that        it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet           They parted my garments among them  and upon my        vesture did they cast lots    First of all  the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine  of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly   We find that right before Jesus dies  the soldiers themselves give him some to drink   not polluted with gall           Jn            Jesus    said   I thirst    A bowl of        vinegar stood there  so they put a sponge full of the        vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth   When he        had received the vinegar  he said   It is finished    But  Matthew seems to be drawing on  not a passage from the prophets  but one from the Psalms           Ps            I looked for pity  but there was none         and for comforters  but I found none   They gave me        poison for food  lit  they put gall in my meat   and        for my thirst  they gave me vinegar to drink     Add        to them punishment upon punishment  may they have no        acquittal from thee   Let them be blotted out of the        Book of the Living   Of course  the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink   This does indeed seem to be a show of pity   The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies   It is not about the messiah or Jesus   It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the  Jesus  in the psalm asks G d for the damnation of the  crucifiers   whereas the Jesus of the gospels says           Lk         Jesus said   Father  forgive them  the        don t know what they do    Further  Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall  a bitter substance  put into Jesus s drink  not his meat  as the psalm stipulates          With the  prophecy  of the vinegar faulty  we naturally ask   What of the casting of lots    This brings up the   nd Psalm  which deserves discussion all by itself   Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus s clothes were divided as told is no great thing   It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days   As we will soon see  it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus   It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus s clothes   For a man so removed from worldly possessions  his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions   The   nd Psalm         This psalm is attributed to David  as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies   It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope   Taken out of context  parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well   We will examine the primary passages          Verse       My god  my god  why have you forsaken me           Why are you so far from helping me  far from the words        of my groaning   Oh  my god  I cry by day  but you        don t answer  and by night  but find no rest   Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross   This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus  rather than king David   Of course  the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution   Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal  he is supposed to be like  the lamb led mute before its shearers    Indeed  Jesus doesn t do much groaning  even when on the cross   He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross                But  I am a worm  and no man   scorned by men            All who see me mock at me   They make faces and wag        their heads    He committed his cause to YHVH   So let        him deliver him    for he delights in him    This seems to fit Jesus s execution pretty well  with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm                  Many bulls encompass me    they open their        mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion                  Yea  dogs are round about me  a company of        evildoers encir cle me  they have pierced my hands and        feet   I can see all my bones    They divide my        garments among them  and cast lost for my raiment                  But you  YHVH  be not far away      Deliver my        soul from the sword  my life from the power of the        dog   Save me from the mouth of the lion  and my        afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull   It would seem quite convincing  and I m sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too   Unfortunately  this prophecy has a fatal flaw   The words  have pierced  really do not exist in the psalm   The correct Hebrew translation is               Yea  dogs are round about me  a company of        evildoers encircles me  like the lion  they are at my        hands and feet     In Hebrew the phrase  like the lion  and a very rare verb form which can mean  pierced  differ by one phonetic character   The word in the Hebrew text is literally   like the lion   ka ari   which makes sense in the context  and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer   It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to  ka aru     But  to add the needed  yet artificial  weight to the  prophecy  this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do   While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus  its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators          Apart from the erroneous verse     the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily   Verse    speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross   This naturally fits the psalm s true subject  king David   As a side note  we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands  the palms  but rather the forearms   This doesn t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms   But then  facts aren t bound by our religious beliefs         Matthew escapes culpability this time  as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus   But the psalm  like many others  was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus s life and death   How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology   It is easy to see  for those who are not faithful fundamentalists  how some of the events in the New Testament might have been  enhanced  by scribes such as the eager Matthew   But  it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims   So far  this has not said good things for St  Matthew   The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus s crucifixion   John s gospel recount  written about    years after the fact  tells us at Jesus s execution           Jn            But one of the soldiers pierced his        side with a spear  and out came blood and water           these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled            The will look on him whom they ve pierced    Of course  this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context    Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them           Zc           And YHVH will give victory to Judah           And on that day  I will seek to destroy the nations        that come against Jerusalem  in Judah    And I will        pour a spirit of compassion and supplication    on        Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have        pierced  they will mourn  and weep bitterly over him        like you weep over a firstborn child   John s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew s attempts   Matthew  at least  usually excontexts more than just one passage   John s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here   It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers  as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded   \\x0c Reckoned with Transgressors          After his arrest  Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship  messiahship    According to one version of the gospel tale  Jesus gets executed along with two thieves           Mk         And with him they crucified two robbers         one on his right  one on his left   And so the        scripture was fulfilled which says           He was reckoned with the transgressors    Here  Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah     about the servant nation of Israel   The passage is not about the messiah  for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah     and its surrounding chapters  one sees that the servant is a nation   The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past  not a prediction of what is to come  in any event   The servant is thought of as a criminal   This also happens to fit the description of Jesus   Had the passage really been about the messiah  it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the  prophecy  in Isaiah   Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry   He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career    Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy  at least in this case  as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons          Mark goes on to tell us how  those who were crucified with  Jesus  also reviled him            This is to be expected from a couple of robbers   Of course in his later recount  St  Luke decides to change some things   Luke tells us           Lk            And one of the criminals who was hanged        with him railed   Aren t you the messiah   Save        yourself  and us    This certainly fits with Mark s recount  which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said   Save yourself   and that the robbers did the same   But then Luke goes on          But the other  criminal  rebuked  the first  saying          Don t you fear G d  since you are under the same        sentence of condemnation   And we  indeed justly so         for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds          But  this man has done nothing wrong  And he said          Jesus  remember me when you come in your kingdom           And Jesus answered   Verily I say to you  today you        will be with me in paradise    Now  this little dialogue seems highly contrived   It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech   We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering    Such a man  apparently noble and of principle  doesn t seem likely to have been a robber   We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke   Of course  Luke s recount also disagrees with Mark s    Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus  not both   It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up  but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G d do not have this avenue open   This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology   In this case  the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems  as we have seen   The End of the World          Mt              Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament   It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories  and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity   Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings  and his disciples ask him about this  and about the end of the world which he has been warning about          The disciples  Tell us  when will this  the temple s        destruction  be  and what will be the sign of your        coming  and of the close of the age          Jesus  Take care that no one leads you astray  for        many will come in my name  saying   I am the christ               you will hear of wars and rumours of wars    for        this must take place  but the end is not yet    For         nation will rise against nation    all this is but the        beginning of the birthpangs               They will deliver you up    put you to death         and false prophets will arise and lead many astray            But he who endures to the end will be saved   This        gospel will be preached throughout the whole world  a        testimony to the nations  and then the end will come               So  when you see the desolation spoken of by the        prophet Daniel     let those who are in Judea flee to        the mountains                Immediately after the tribulation of those days         the sun will be darkened    the stars will fall from        heaven    then will appear the sign of the Son of Man        in heaven  and all the tribes of the earth will mourn         and see the Son of Man coming    and he will send out        his angels    and gather his elect                 Learn the lesson of the fig tree  as soon as its        branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves  you know        that summer is near   So also  when you see all these        things  you will know that He is near  at the very        gate   Truly I say to you  this generation will not        pass away until all these things take place                 But  of the day and hour  no one knows  not the        angels  not the Son  but only the Father    Therefore         you also must be ready  for the Son of Man is coming        at an hour you do not expect   From this  it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples   He tells them that although he doesn t know the exact day or hour  that it will come  and thus they must be ready   Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error   But  unfortunately  Jesus made himself to explicit   He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End  and that they in particular should prepare for it  prepare to be swept away        There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible  and said that the phrase   this generation shall not pass away     really means  this race of people will not pass away      Of course  the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that  the generation of the disciples   It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek  he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear   But  it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples  at least some of them  are supposed to live to the End of the World   The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles  responses   It becomes abundantly clear from Rev          Peter        John       and Rev         that Jesus meant exactly what he said   The End was very near          For       years  Christians have rationalised this   th chapter of Matthew  or ignored its meaning altogether   For       years  they have waited for their executed leader to come back  hearing of wars  and rumours of wars  sure that He is coming soon   Surely He must be   All we must do is wait   Can you imagine how tired He must be  sitting around up there  being holy  waiting for just the right moment to spring           So  shortly after his crucifixion  Jesus of Nazareth   Joshua ben Joseph   died    It is said that after three days  or three days and three nights  or three periods of time  or three eternal seconds   or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble   he was seen again  resurrected  glowing with divine radiance   Then the Saviour decided it wasn t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around  and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven   So the story goes  anyway   As has been seen  there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down   To them  Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture   We have seen  though  that this matter is quite shaky   But  throughout Church history  Christians have held fast to faith  in simple belief   What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force  faith and forgetfulness kept away from question   To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters   Thus for       years  the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted   Things may well continue that way for some time   Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used  properly or improperly  to support wars and persecution  I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold ',\n",

ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN     Born         Senior Engineer    Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association     Resident at Building      B  Apartment       Microdistrict No       Sumgait  Azerbaijan    What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy  an awful tragedy for us  the  Armenian people  and for all of mankind  A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime   And it was a great tragedy for me personally  because I lost my father in those days  He was still young  Born in        On that day  February     we were at home  Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town  my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it  But we  didn t think       we thought that everything would happen outdoors  that they wouldn t go into people s apartments  About five o clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict  We were sitting at home  watching television  We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street  This is right near downtown  next to the airline ticket office  our  house is right nearby  That day there was a group of policeman with shields there  They threw rocks at those policemen  Then they moved off in the  direction of our building  They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building  We switched off  the light  As it turns out  their signal was just the opposite  to turn on the light  That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home  We  of course  didn t know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment   Suddenly there s pounding on the door  We go to the door  all four of us  there were four of us in the apartment  Father  Mother  my younger brother Aleksandr  and I  He was born in       My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East  he was a pilot   We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder  breaking it down  with axes  We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani   What s going on  What s  happened   They say   Armenians  get out of here   We don t open the door  we  say   If we have to leave  we ll leave  we ll leave tomorrow   They say   No   leave now  get out of here  Armenian dogs  get out of here   By now they ve  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides  We hold them off as best we can  my father and I on one side  and my mother and brother on the other   We had prepared ourselves  we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment  and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves  They broke in the door and when the door gave way  we held it for another half hour  No neighbors  no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time  We  held the door  They started to smash the door on the lock side  first with an  axe  and then with a crowbar   When the door gave way  they tore it off its hinges  Sasha hit one of them  with the axe  The axe flew out of his hands  They also had axes  crowbars   pipes  and special rods made from armature shafts  One of them hit my father  in the head  The pressure from the mob was immense  When we retreated into the room  one of them hit my mother  too  in the left part of her face  My brother Sasha and I fought back  of course  Sasha is quite strong and hot tempered  he was the judo champion of Sumgait  We had hammers in our hands  and we injured  several of the bandits  in the heads and in the eyes  all that went on  But  they  the injured ones  fell back  and others came to take their places  there were many of them   The door fell down at an angle  The mob tried to remove the door  so as to go  into the second room and to continue       to finish us off  Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me  we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding  his face was covered with blood  he had been wounded in the head   and his whole face was bloody  We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that  We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall  drove them down to the third floor  We came out on the landing  but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there  having closed the door behind them  We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them  Then a man  an imposing man of  about     an Azerbaijani  came in  When he was coming in  Father fell down and Mother flew to him  and started to cry out  I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance  but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen  We live on the fourth floor  And no  one came  I went into the room  It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group  He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar  And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani   What s with you   woman  why are you shouting  What happened  Why are you shouting like that   She says   What do you mean  what happened  You killed somebody   My father  was a musician  he played the clarinet  he played at many weddings  Armenian  and Azerbaijani  he played for many years  Everyone knew him  Mother says    The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings  he  brought so much joy to people  and you killed that person   He says   You  don t need to shout  stop shouting   And when they heard the voice of this  man  the    to    people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out  We chased after them  but they ran away  That man left   too  As we were later told  downstairs one of them told the others  I don t  know if it was from fright or what  told them that we had firearms  even though we only fought with hammers and an axe  We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart  but it was already too late  We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance  The ambulance never came  although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night   Somewhere around midnight about    policemen came  They informed us they were  from Khachmas  They said   We heard that a group was here at your place  you  have our condolences   They told us not to touch anything and left  Father lay in the room   So we stayed home  Each of us took a hammer and a knife  We sat at home  Well  we say  if they descend on us again we ll defend ourselves  Somewhere around  one o clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy   investigators  They say   Leave everything just how it is  we re coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything   Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too  but no one helped us take  Father away  The morning came and the neighbors arrived  We wanted to take  Father away somehow  We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times  but no one came  We called an ambulance  and nobody came  Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide  We secured the door somehow or other  We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor s   The excesses began again in the morning  The bandits came in several vehicles  ZIL panel trucks  and threw themselves out of the vehicles like       a  landing force near the center of town  Our building was located right there  A crowd formed  Then they started fighting with the soldiers  Then  in Buildings    and     that s next to the airline ticket office  they started breaking  into Armenian apartments  destroying property  and stealing  The Armenians  weren t at home  they had managed to flee and hide somewhere  And again they  poured in the direction of our building  They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor  meaning us   They re up there  still  up there  Let s go kill them   They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms  threw it outside  and burned it in large fires  We were hiding  one floor up  Something heavy fell  Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father  they had thrown Father  were defiling  the corpse  probably throwing it in the fire  going to burn it  I heard it   and the sound was kind of hollow  and I said   No  that s from some of the  furniture   Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow  and calmed  him down   The mob left somewhere around eight o clock  They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us  They were also Armenians  they had left for another city   The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said   Are you  crazy  Why are you hiding Armenians  Don t you now they re checking all the  apartments  They could kill you and them   And to us          Come on  leave  this apartment   We went down to the third floor  to some other neighbors   At first the man didn t want to let us in  but then one of his sons asked him and he relented  We stayed there until eleven o clock at night  We heard the sound of motors  The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers  We went  downstairs  There was a light on in the room where we left Father  In the  other rooms  as we found out later  all the chandeliers had been torn down   They left only one bulb  The bulb was burning  which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict   where there had been a pogrom   With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved  Our salvation  my mother s  my brother s  and mine   was purely  accidental  because  as we later found out from the neighbors  someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there  Well  we fought  but we were only able to save Mother  We couldn t save Father  We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits  some of them serious  But others came to take their places  We  were also wounded  there was blood  and we were scratched all over  we got our share  It was a miracle we survived  We were saved by a miracle and the  troops  And if troops hadn t come to Sumgait  the slaughter would have been  even greater  probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide   Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city  and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us  experts  We went to   pick up Father s corpse  We took it to the morgue  This was about two o clock  in the morning  it was already March    it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold  and we were wearing only our suits  When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses  There were  about six burned people in there  and the small corpse of a burned child  It  was gruesome  I suffered a tremendous shock  There were about ten people  there  but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku  There was a woman s corpse there too  she had been       well   there was part of a body there       a hacked off part of a woman s body  It  was something terrible  The morgue was guarded by the landing force       The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old  It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned  There was a  man there  too  several men  You couldn t tell anything because their faces  were disfigured  they were in such awful condition     Now two and a half months have passed  Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait  Every day  my father  and the death of my  father  and how we fought  and the people s sorrow  and especially the morgue   I still want to say that    years have passed since Soviet power was established  and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait  It will go down in history   I m particularly surprised that the mob wasn t even afraid of the troops  They even fought the soldiers  Many soldiers were wounded  The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers  setting them on fire  They  weren t afraid  They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops  I saw the clashes on February    near the airline ticket office  right across from our building  And that mob was fighting with the soldiers  The  inhabitants of some of the buildings  also Azerbaijanis  threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows  balconies  even cinder blocks and glass tanks  They  weren t afraid of them  I say they were sure of their impunity  When we were  at the neighbors  and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number         and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes  And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned  During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone s aid  No one came to help us  either  to our home  even though perhaps they could have come and saved us   As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs  near the bus  station  Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting  So I think all of it was arranged in advance  They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived  on which floors  they had lists  the bandits  You can tell that the  operation  was  planned in advance   Thanks  of course  to our troops  to the country s leadership  and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us  thanks to the Russian people  because the majority of the troops were Russians  and the troops  suffered losses  too  I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians  and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians  For coming in time and averting terrible things  worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time   At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy  I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment  because if they don t  the tragedy  the genocide  could  happen again  Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds   Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest  in the mass  disturbances  The mobs were huge  At present not all of them have been caught  very few of them have been  I think  judging by the newspaper reports  There  were around    people near our building alone  that s how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all   They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts      May             Yerevan  \\t\\t           reference            _The Sumgait Tragedy

              " 'Mr DeCenso  in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas  rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject    and    Actually  if you do further research as to the Greek word  apacgw   you will find that it does denote success   Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful   As I pointed out  I recently checked several Lexicons   \\t Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Louw and Nida \\t Robinson s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament  \\t Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Grimm \\t Word study Concordance   Tynsdale \\t A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  \\t early Christian Writings   Bauer Arndt Gingrich \\t The New Analytical Greek Lexicon   Perschbacher  A couple simply stated  hanged oneself   and a couple were more explicit  and stated that  apacgw  means specifically  kill yourself by hanging   A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for  apacgw  is  strangle  throttle or choke   which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down    One of the best references though   Robinson s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament   not only stated the translation  it gave both the root words  the literal translation  related greek words which use the same roots  and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature  to give further context      The word  apagchw  has two root words   gchw  is the  to strangle  root  and the root word  apo  means literally  away   This root words is included in words which denote a transition   It can mean a transition in place  eg  the greek word  apagello  means to send a message     Apo  can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death   Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word  apokteiuo   which means  to kill   In literal meaning the word  apacgw  means  to throttle  strangle to put out of the way   and implicitly denotes a change in life state  ie  away from life  to death    So while the word  apacgw  does mean  to hang   it specifically denotes a death as well   Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means  to hang oneself  to end one s life by hanging   He then notes the the use of  apacgw  in Homers Odessy        to denote context   He presents that example of  apacgw  as being used to explicitly mean  suicide by hanging   Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling  without the added denotation of  death   and as you insist that the Bible was written by God  and every word is precicely correct  you are stuck with the complete meaning of  apacgw   ie  Since the word  apacgw  was used  then death is denoted as the result     By the way  I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of  apacgw     Note Mr DeCenso  as you say  the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek  and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew  ie  the the Hebrew say  and died    and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek   It should also be pointed out that  regardless of the added  and died   the correct translation would still be  apacgw   as the man did indeed die from strangulation  redundant  but correct    Further  we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited  which included versions which contradicted each other   and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks   Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands  as a paragon of ancient greek   So  what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso  is an example  in ancient greek  of someone committing  apacgw  and surviving   Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence    Now I would note Mr DeCenso  that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis  I pretty much find it false   Thus  I think that if you are going to add to the text  something over and above what the source clearly says  then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it    By the way  as to Mr Rose s statement about trees around the Potter s Field    Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old  or that there are      year old stumps there  or has a   thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees  then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago  after all  things change     Now as to your other argument  ie  that the money Judas used is not the same as the    silvers    True  Peter  or the author of Acts  does not specifically call Judas  betrayal  an iniquity   but for that matter  neither does John specifically call Judas  actions  an iniquity  either   Further John       did not say that Judas took       Some thought that because  Judas had the money box  Jesus was telling      him  Buy what we need for the feast   or that he should give something      to the poor  So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out  and      it was night    Note that it is said that Judas left  it does not say that he took the money box   Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity  mentioned by another author  in a different book  written at a different time  over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts   I find this forced and contrived    Of course this particular argument becomes moot  since we have have seen evidence that  apacgw  means suicide   You see  since Judas  hanging was successful  he could not have spent the money mentioned in John        because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day  ie  Passover   and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day   Thus the money which bought the  Field of Blood  would have to have been the    pieces of silver  Of course he got the    pieces of silver that night as well  and thus couldn t have spent that either   Oh dear  I believe that the house of cards is comming down     Maybe we should at this point  discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas   By the way  as to where the prophesy of the Potter s field came from  ie  the mention of it in Matthew   you say    I am reminding you now to discuss it now  It s all part of the same verse we are discussing  and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues    \\t\\t\\t\\tLater
